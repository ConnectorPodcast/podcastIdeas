# podcast Ideas

The whole point on this podcast is to get more involved in the community and not only on Microsoft world.
The ideal way to do this would be between Hasan and Myself, we have very diverse background and different ways of seeing and acting on things. I am early in career at Microsoft and Hasan has a vast experience in the tech world. We can benefit from not only working in different areas like Engineering and Product Management, but also from our life experience and encourage growth mentality and lifelong learning culture.

	• The first couple of episodes would be talking about who we are and what we are trying to accomplish with this, I can imagine the format would be:
		○ Introduction
		○ How was your last couple weeks since we last spoke and what did you learn
		○ What are you working on (this is a good way to show what we do for a living and the life of a PM/DEV/Manager
		○ What do you want to accomplish in the near future, until we meet again?
		○ Have you identified an expert in that field?
			§ This can be technical or non technical at all
		○ How can we get to that person? How do you think we can make a connection with them?
			§ This is where we teach some ways to make connections, how to find someone, how to reach out, how to involve ourselves in that particular community, etc
		○ Identify actionable items and plan or schedule them. This is where we can show people different methods of planning and execution (Agile, Kanban, ToDo lists, Pomodoro, Rubber Ducking, etc) and ways they can implement those methods into their everyday life.
	• We can pith this to the Aspire community and allow them to also help us with the topics we can have on our discussions. If this happens:
		○ We can have a different Aspire Leadership Council member each episode, this will allow us to get different perspectives and experiences.
		○ If this is part of the Aspire program, we can prepare talks based on their Mission and we can help people connect and create communities…

The way I see it, we can have a Twitter/Insta/YouTube/Twitch account and we can use this to promote and grow our community. I believe in the power of the people. Let's get to them and empower them to do more.
